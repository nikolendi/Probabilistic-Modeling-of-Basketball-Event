This work presents an analysis within event sequences in basketball
games using Play-by-Play data from the 2024-2025 Season of the Second Austrian Bundesliga. It explores the most common transitions between in-game events through probabilistic models along with discrete-time
Markov chains. Two variants of the Markov model are developed and compared: a first-order model based on individual events, and a secondorder model that incorporates combinations of two consecutive events.
EvtRelFreq model was built for prediction of the next event on relative
frequencies. The second developed model is a DurSample used to simulate
the duration between consecutive events.
In addition, principal component analysis was applied to the transition
matrices in order to visualize and cluster event sequences. The PCA-based
exploration complements the Markov framework by highlighting patterns
in event transitions that align closely with actual basketball strategies.
Simulations do validate all of the constructed models. Real game data
can be compared to all of the models too. The potential of probabilistic
models is demonstrated by the results, for describing and for predicting
dynamics of basketball games and for laying the groundwork for tactical
simulations.
